# FAS Reporting

According to Bank of Slovenian rules, business entities, who are requested to submit finance account statistics data, should report data on the state of financial assets and liabilities in financial accounts and on transaction changes in value of financial assets and liabilities.

The data for financial accounts statistics must be submitted by all institutional units which, according to the standard classification of institutional sectors according to the regulation, are classified into sectors 11, 12 and 13 and are determined by the decision on reporting or the criteria for assessing the reporting obligations by the Bank of Slovenia:

-for sector 11 or non-financial corporations, the balance sheet total (asset value) at the end of the calendar year prior to the reporting period, EUR 2 million or more,

-for sector 12 or financial corporations, the balance sheet total (asset value) at the end of the calendar year, before the period for which data are reported, EUR 1 million or more,

-for sector 13 or institutional units of central and local government, the balance sheet total (asset value) at the end of the calendar year, before the reporting period, is EUR 8 million or more.

Institutional units established during the year assess the reporting obligation by assessing the balance sheet at the end of the quarter for which data are reported.
